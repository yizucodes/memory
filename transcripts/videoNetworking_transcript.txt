 Hey Marlon, nice to meet you. Yeah, nice to meet you. How are you doing today? I'm pretty good. I'm here, you know, interested in your company. I hear that, you know, Meta is working on some amazing new wearable devices and I'm really excited. I come from a marketing background and would love to know more. So what are some of the interesting things that are happening over at your company? So we're trying to build like really cool technology wearables like trying to integrate different multi-model like video, speech and text into more insightful insights with our Lama models. So what interests you at Meta? We're trying to hire machine learning engineers that are more, that can bridge this kind of gap and then work on these really exciting stuff. So why are you interested in Meta? I'm really interested in wearables for, you know, mass market adoption. So familiar devices like glasses, watches. I have worked in VR in the past, but I'm also, you know, really excited about, you know, everyday like smart home things as well, displays, you know, and LLMs and how they integrate with that. But, you know, maybe there's somebody that you recommend that I talk to that's maybe on the more on the go to market side. I can forward this question to my colleagues. I think that's a great question. So what like what do you think your skill sets, how do they align to what we're looking for? Yeah, definitely. I think that like commercialization is really important for a lot of new form factors, you know, familiar form factors that have new capabilities. So, you know, really looking to, you know, find where the most value is for the most, you know, at a good price point, I think is where, you know, I'm excited to, you know, contribute. But yeah, if you could connect me with your colleague to talk more about the marketing side, that would be awesome. I really appreciate that. Awesome. Yeah. Cool. Thank you. So, yeah, so in that case, if I had like a summary or something, I'd be like, okay, like this is what they're looking for. This is they said that we would talk about they were introducing me. So it stays automatically? Yeah.
