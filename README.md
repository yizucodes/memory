# Meta Glasses Memory Assistant 🕶️

**A Llama-powered personal memory system that processes Meta Ray-Ban glasses footage to help you recall conversations, insights, and daily moments through intelligent video analysis.**

*Built for the Llama Hackathon - Your AI companion for augmented memory*

## ⚡ Hackathon Status & Integration

### **🚀 What's Working (24-hour MVP)**
- ✅ **Complete video processing pipeline** for Meta glasses footage
- ✅ **Advanced transcription** with OpenAI Whisper (5 models)
- ✅ **Smart frame extraction** optimized for conversations
- ✅ **Llama 4 integration** with multimodal understanding
- ✅ **Natural language querying** via API
- ✅ **Batch processing** for multiple videos

## 🎮 Live Demo Examples

### **Demo Scenario**: Coffee Meeting
**Meta Glasses captured** a 15-minute coffee conversation about a new project.

**WebAI Processing Flow:**
```
1. Media Loader: Ingests glasses video file
2. Video Processor: Extracts 3 conversation frames + full transcript
3. Llama Element: Stores multimodal context with conversation understanding
4. API Element: Provides query interface
```

**Query Demo:**
```
You: "What did Sarah and I discuss about project timelines?"

Memory Assistant: "You and Sarah discussed a new project timeline during your coffee meeting. Sarah expressed concern about the Q4 deadline being too aggressive, suggesting a 2-week buffer for testing. You agreed to present a revised timeline to stakeholders by Friday. She also mentioned her team's availability might be limited in December due to holiday schedules."
```

### **Follow-Up Questions**
```
You: "What exactly did Sarah say about the December availability?"

Memory Assistant: "Sarah specifically mentioned that her team's availability might be limited in December due to holiday schedules. She seemed concerned about the impact on the project timeline and suggested planning critical work to complete before the holiday season."
```

### **Cross-Video Context**
```
You: "Has anyone else mentioned timeline concerns recently?"

Memory Assistant: "Yes! In your Monday team meeting, Mike also expressed concerns about aggressive timelines, specifically mentioning that the Q3 project overran by two weeks. This seems to be a recurring theme in your recent project discussions."
```
